    "   Observations from Exploring the Data:  \n",
    "   There are 26 number of rows.  \n",
    "   There are 11 number of columns.  \n",
    "   Key Issues Identified:  \n",
    "   Missing values in Effective Date, Financing Type, and Investors columns.  \n",
    "   Amount column contains currency symbols and inconsistent formats (e.g., \"$1.9b\", \"Â£41.7m\").  \n",
    "   Categories and Investors are stored as strings instead of structured lists.  \n",
    "   Date columns (Effective Date, Found At) are in object format, requiring conversion to datetime.\n",

    "   **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Steps Taken to Clean, Preprocess, and Transform the Data:\n",
    "   i. Handle Missing Values:\n",
    "   Replace missing dates and categories with \"Unknown\".\n",
    "   Fill missing investors with \"No Investors\".\n",
    "\n",
    "   ii. Convert Data Types:\n",
    "   Convert Effective Date and Found At columns to datetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "   iii. Normalize the Amount Column:\n",
    "   Clean and convert the Amount column to a numeric format.\n",
    "\n",
    "   iv. Split Complex Fields:\n",
    "   Extract individual categories and investors for better analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "   v. Check for Duplicates and Consistency:\n",
    "   Ensure there are no duplicate rows and verify unique entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** Justifications for each technique or decision you applied.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Answer:**  \n",
    "   * Handling Missing Data: Essential to ensure analysis completeness without discarding valuable records.\n",
    "   * Data Type Conversion: Ensures accurate calculations and time-based trend analysis.\n",
    "   * Amount Normalization: Converts values into a standard format for meaningful comparisons.\n",
    "   * Splitting Fields: Improves the ability to analyze investor participation and funding types.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**4.** Reflections on the importance of preprocessing in real-world data analysis.  \n",
    "   **Answer:**\n",
    "   Preprocessing is vital because:\n",
    "   * It ensures data integrity and quality.\n",
    "   * Facilitates accurate modeling and analysis.\n",
    "   * Helps uncover hidden patterns by structuring complex information.\n",
    "   * Reduces errors caused by inconsistent or incomplete data."
